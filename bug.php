In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with sessions and unserialization. If a session variable contains an object that has changed significantly since it was serialized (e.g., new properties added or removed), attempting to unserialize it may lead to unexpected behavior or even fatal errors. This is because the unserialization process expects the structure of the object to match the serialized data exactly.  The error might not be immediately obvious, resulting in inconsistent behavior difficult to debug.

Example of problematic code:
```php
<?php
// Session variable containing an object
$_SESSION['user'] = serialize(new User('John', 'Doe'));

// ... some time later ...

// Assuming the User class has changed in the meantime (e.g., a new property added)
$user = unserialize($_SESSION['user']);

// Accessing the new property might lead to undefined behavior.
// var_dump($user->newProperty); // Might throw an error or return NULL
?>
```
